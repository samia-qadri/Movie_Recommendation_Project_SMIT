🎬 Movie Recommendation System :

 > Project Overview : 
 
This project is our Final Group Project for the AI and Data Science course and represents the combined effort of our team throughout the semester.

We built a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies to users based on similarity, preferences, and patterns found in the data. The project allowed us to practically apply concepts of data science, machine learning, and data preprocessing that we studied during the course.

This project reflects not just technical implementation, but also teamwork, problem-solving, and real-world application of AI concepts.

> Key Features :

  ~ Movie recommendation based on similarity

  ~ Data preprocessing and cleaning

  ~ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  ~ User-friendly recommendation logic

  ~ Implemented using Python libraries

  > Dataset :
> The data set has been taken from Kaggle
